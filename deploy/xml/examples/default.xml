		<text target="body"><![CDATA[ramen Player represents my 5th generation dynamic Flash/XML framework. It’s a highly customizable XML driven web site frame work that allows for the rapid development of a fullscreen Flash web site.<br><br>It focuses on small file sizes, UI cusomtization and site structure customization. My old monolithic page template/framework approach has been replaced by an exerternal SWF model. It also has a “page object” system that allows image, text fields, shape primiatives, audio players, and a few others things, to be added to any page. These objects may have animations (using CS3 animation XML), transitions, and trigger events that affect other objects. So a unique interactive page may be created entirely in XML without any timeline animation or scripting in the Flash environment. Kind of like my own simple MXML.]]></text>
