Player Framework Master To Do List
Last updated: 11.17.09
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WATCH ISSUES

Page that tries to disable Next/Back/Refesh with a NavigationUIEvent: 
	REASON - colliding with the player unlocking linear navigation on template page render
	SOLUTION - move player unlock to page load, not render
Backing up in to an unanswered scored page
	REASON - this isn't trapped
	SOLTUION - add logic
A persitant popup looses tabindex after a page change
	The AssessmentManager class doesn't support persitant popups, all non framework items are cleared on page change
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPEN
[ ] = open, [] = low pri, [!] = high pri, [x] = completed, [?] = unsure, [-] partial
